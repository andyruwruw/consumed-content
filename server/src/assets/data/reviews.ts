  'this film actually was a tad dull',
  'I quite liked the ending, it was an interesting conclusion, obviously there will be a few of these, but the finale has left me wanting to see the next one.',
  'Hopefully though you won\'t care and buy into the whole suspense and what\'s going on, who are we kind of vibe the movie is sending out. The questions that you won\'t get an answer to in this movie and many things that feel like they are wrong if you think about them, should only start if you are not affected by that vibe. It\'s a bit male dominated, but still a nice watch',
  'I wasn\'t impressed.',
  'I really look forward to a sequel.',
  'There is Nothing more Disappointing in a Movie that sets up a Mysterious, Where Are We?, Why Are We Here?, Premise and then Delivers a Confusing, Open-Ended, Non-Answer to it all and has the Conceit to ask You to Sign Up for the Sequel. No Thanks.',
  'It is such a Letdown and a Cheat it Doesn\'t Deserve a Return, except maybe on Your Ticket Price for this Unoriginal, Bland, Sterile, Non-Frightening Film. The Characters are Uninteresting and there are a Lot of them. But most are Indistinguishable, except for Skin Color and Accents.',
  'This is a Non Entity in the Young Adult Fantasy Fad, Based on Best Selling Books Popularly Purchased by You guessed it, Young Adults. Well, at Least some of Them are Reading. Hope the Books are Better than this Almost Awful, Anemic, Non-Adventure.',
  'The action is fantastic. The idea is terrific.',
  'Everything comes together. This is funny and exciting.',
  'I had expected a good old fashioned shooter em up movie, I didn\'t expect a movie that dealt with such clever themes, including recursion and continued death.',
  'The movie is not a cheat: it packs in a lot of astounding action, but that\'s all it is, action for it\'s own sake. The art directors go for overkill in dazzling this thing up, but lovers of intriguing and substantial content will feel undernourished. The film gives you your money\'s worth, sure, but only in style.',
  'it was also quite enjoyable, though for me the last thirty minutes were a minor let down. Now most will probably LOVE the over-the-top action and it was a cute parody on the "buddy cop" films, but I think I enjoyed the stupider and quieter moments in the film just a bit more. These charming little scenes of daffiness reminded me a lot of the town from the great BBC series, "The Vicar of Dibley".',
  'The only negatives I would note are the film style and the violence. As far as the style goes, sometimes the choppy and "hip" edits actually seemed like overkill. Many may like it--I think it was just trying a bit too hard. As for the violence, for adults it\'s fine and appropriate, but since I am a school teacher I am a bit concerned to hear that so many young kids went to see it. For an older teen, it\'s a good film, but with kids as young as 10 or 12 apparently seeing the film, this is sad. Where are the parents and why the heck won\'t they exercise a bit of common sense?! This is a rated R movie because it\'s so violent--not the sort of fare younger kids should be watching.',
  'I will admit to you, the film does start off slowly, and the finale is very over the top. Plus the murders are unashamedly brutal.',
  ' The supporting actors do just as brilliantly with Nick Frost the standout and Jim Broadbent brilliant as always. Paddy Cosidine and Rafe Spall are hilarious as the two Andys, and Timothy Dalton is a pleasant surprise as Simon Skinner, and steals every scene he\'s in.',
  'The camera-work is very dark and brooding, and there are some clever homages to other movies of the genre. At a little over two hours, the film is perhaps a little too long, but the film constantly goes at a break neck pace so it doesn\'t matter. The plot is rather original and daring, about Nick Angel getting promoted and being relocated to the hamlet of Sandford. The direction from Edgar Wright is solid throughout and has this appropriately offbeat style. Overall, a very affectionate, daring and enjoyable film.',
  'Pegg and Frost continue their great chemistry with Edgar for almost a decade. It also serves as a fun whodunnit mystery. It\'s choked full of big British stars doing cameos. The last act does get overwhelmed with gun action and the guys struggle to maintain the comedy. They took the Bad Boys and Point Break motif too seriously. Overall, this may not be a comedy for everybody but it\'s a comedy for me.',
  'With a script by Pegg and director Edgar Wright, this seems to be the least regarded of their "Cornetto" movies. I think it\'s hilarious, as it mercilessly takes apart every cop movie cliche in a small village, with the high-speed editing by Chris Dickens letting you know that events are linked. There are plenty of blink-and-you\'ll-miss-him cameos, and you need to pay attention to every moment. Wright doesn\'t stop for a good gag or meaningless shot. I think it\'s possibly the best comedy movie of the last twenty years.',
  'Nicholas Angel joined the police service and quickly made a name for himself, achieving an arrest rate 400% higher than anyone else and breaking many service records. Unfortunately this makes his colleagues look bad and he is "promoted" to Sergeant, not in London but in the leafy village of Sandford. Bitter but with no choice, Angel finds himself in the crime-free village and, although he tries to continue his work he finds the only criminals he can arrest are kids and a drunk-driver who turns out to be his new partner, Danny. However the accident rate in Sandford is surely far too high  a fact brought home to Angel when a series of grizzly "accidents" occur. But will anyone listen in a village where everyone knows no crimes ever occur.',
  'It does this very well by taking the conventions of the genre and putting them into rural England. The former is really well done and is never as lazy as some spoofs where such conventions are explained then spoofed  here they are part of the film and it works better for it. It is worth noting that they also do small village life to a tee as well. The obsession with keeping the image of the village and intolerance for outsiders is well used within the narrative and will strike a chord with those that know. The action is kept for the final third of the film but is better for it because, for the majority of the film it is witty, but the action is more silly humour  it works, but it is best that it is limited.',
  'It is not a perfect film though and those expected a fantastic action movie with loads of laughs will be disappointed. The humour is more about wit and references rather than being a laugh a minute affair. Personally I found it very funny but then some people hated Spaced so I imagine they will also hate this. The direction from Wright is really good. Some of the cuts were a bit frantic at times for my liking but mostly it all looked good and played very well. The cast is roundly good and blessed with stars. Pegg mostly plays it straight and it is an approach that works as the script feeds a lot of the sillier lines to Frost, who delivers them spot on. The two have a great sense of semi-homoerotic camaraderie between them that really fits the action film idea. At first I did worry that the parade of British stars would distract but, aside from the early appearance of Coogan, Nighy and Freeman, it didn\'t really. Dalton was huge fun, Broadbent fitted his character like old slippers and support is roundly strong from Considine, Woodward, Bailey, Colman, Spall and others.',
  'It won\'t be to everyone tastes then, and those expecting to be rolling in the aisles may be building it up too much. It a witty and English take on the staples of the Hollywood action movie. It is a bit long and gets silly at the end but mostly it is a lot of fun and the same audience that enjoyed Shaun will find this just as much fun.',
  'A good spoof movie takes the movies it spoofs literally. They show love for the movies they caricature! And this is the case here, too! Coming hot from the Shaun of the Dead success (I personally haven\'t seen their popular Spaced series), the boys here again aim and hit their targets!',
  'After doing a good job and making other officers look bad, a detective is transferred to a sleepy village where everything is done for the greater good. Soon, he begins to clean up... but there\'s a killer on the loose! So this vacation gets a bit more exciting because this silt just got real.',
  'Over-hyped. Yes! Over-rated. Probably.',
  'It is so amazingly funny. Every scene is set up to have a hilarious atmosphere. Every character is funny and likable in some way. Nicholas Angel is a righteous policeman, he is very good at what he does. He is a great contrast with the other village policemen, who are so lazy and mischievous. I enjoy watching the power struggle between Nicolas and Inspector Frank Butterman. The battles between them are clear, yet they do not come across as being malicious.',
  'The plot is excellent. It manages to pack in so much fun, action and horror in just two hours. The plot twists are very unpredictable, and every twist leads to yet another adventure. Who would have thought a comedy would have full scale shootouts in a supermarkets and high speed car chases? ',
